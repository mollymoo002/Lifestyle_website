        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Molly and I am 30 years old. For as long as I can remember, I was the person who procrastinated through life and wishing for a better way to get things
            done. When I was pregnant with my daughter, I noticed that there were two types of mothers on the internet that were the loudest:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Crunchy Mom: The mom who can do it all including eating raw oats like a horse and keeping an all-white kitchen spotless</li>
            <li>
                The Cool Lazy Mom: I guess there was a backlash to the crunchy mom and created this mom who has an extremely messy house and their kids eat nothing but pixie
                sticks and soggy chicken nuggets
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Where was someone like me? A mom who is a little of both and is just trying their best to survive and thrive? I came to the realization that we were too busy living
            our lives to give out strange advice and set up a ring light for the thousandth time.

            I am a gamer, reader, developer, mother, wife, friend, sister, aunt, niece, and human. I love to cook and stream in my limited free time. Check out some of these other
            pages to see some things I've picked up over the years. Enjoy!
