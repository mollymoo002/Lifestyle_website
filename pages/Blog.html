<h1>My Thoughts</h1>

<p>I can never remember my thoughts and ideas and forget to write it down because I don't take my notebook everywhere. If it was a part of updating a website however, I am
    hoping it motivates me to write it all down

    <p>
        I just moved around my office and got rid of my third monitor because it was just too much and I wanted to make it more minimalist. Maybe I'll get a smaller desk, but
        for now I'll make it work with my l-shaped glass top. I think a lot about what I would do if I won the lottery and I think I would just stream all day and help out my
        family with other things they need. I need to let go of that dream because I am never going to win the lottery lol.
