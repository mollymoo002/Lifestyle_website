<h1>Molly Sings Life and Things</h1>
<p>Come on in and get to know me!</p>

<p>I love making websites and coding, but lately I have put it down because I code for a living. I wanted to make a site where I can add the things I find fun and helpful.
   I am the type of person who writes down everything just in case I forget and it's important.
</p>
<p>
    Does anyone else have a bunch of cookbooks or coffee table books that look nice but you never read? This is mostly what this site is going to be: notes about interesting
    books so I can bring it up later! Recipes, decorative items, video games, and more.
